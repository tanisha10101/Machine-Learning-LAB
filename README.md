### 5. Reinforcement Learning
- Implementing a reinforcement learning algorithm on a dataset to learn optimal actions.

### 6. Density-based Clustering
- Using density-based clustering for data sampling and estimation.

### 7. Model Regularization, PCA, Feature Selection
- Applying model regularization, PCA for dimensionality reduction, and feature selection methods to optimize models.

### 8. Kernel-based SVM Model
- Implementing SVM models with Gaussian (RBF) and Sigmoid kernels for classification tasks.

### 9. Ensemble Methods & Optimization
- Using ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to improve model performance.

### 10. Over-sampling & Under-sampling
- Handling imbalanced data through over-sampling and under-sampling techniques.
